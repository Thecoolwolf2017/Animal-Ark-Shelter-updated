# Pet Commands

Follow
- Pet joins your group and follows you. If you enter a vehicle, it will enter too. Exits when you do.

Stay
- Pet leaves your group and holds position. It will not auto-enter/exit vehicles.

Come Here
- Clears idle/scenario and runs to you (or warps if far). Switches to Follow on arrival.

Sit / Lay Down
- Clears follow/idle, then plays a stable anim (dogs: sit/lay; cats: relaxing base). Use Follow to resume.

Enter/Exit Vehicle
- Forces the pet in/out. When in, it plays the appropriate pose.

Treat / Medkit
- Heals by a small or large amount.

Dismiss
- Removes the pet and hides the HUD and interaction menu.
