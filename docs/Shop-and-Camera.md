# Shop & Camera

Showcase and Camera
- The shop uses a fixed anchor at `[Shop] X/Y/Z`.
- `ShowcaseOffset*` sets where the animal spawns relative to that anchor.
- `CameraOffset*` sets where the camera is placed. The camera will raise to avoid ground clipping and look slightly above the animal.

Shopkeeper
- `ShopkeeperOffset*` sets where the clerk spawns; `ShopkeeperModel` controls the model.
- The shopkeeper is spawned while the shop menu is open and despawned when closed.

Input Lock
- While the shop menu is visible, gameplay controls are disabled so you interact with the menu only.

Tips
- If the scene looks off for your shelter, nudge the offsets by 0.5â€“1.0.
