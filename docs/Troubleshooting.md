# Troubleshooting

Mod not loading
- Ensure ScriptHookV and ScriptHookVDotNet3 are installed and up-to-date.
- Ensure files are placed in `Grand Theft Auto V\scripts`.

Shop/menu not showing
- Verify `LemonUI.SHVDN3.dll` exists in `scripts`.
- Approach the shelter marker within ~1.5m.

Camera looks odd
- Tune `[Shop] CameraOffset*` and `ShowcaseOffset*` for your anchor.

Pet won’t come
- Use “Come Here” once; it clears tasks and switches to Follow on arrival.

Pet doesn’t sit or sits abruptly
- Sitting now clears tasks first; if it still snaps, try Sit after issuing Stay.

Cat clipping in seats
- Cats use a compact idle when seated to reduce clipping; seat availability still varies by vehicle.
